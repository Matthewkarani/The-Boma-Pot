### Business Description 
Tasty Dishes is a web-based culinary platform dedicated to sharing authentic African recipes with the world. Our mission is to enhance the cooking experience of home chefs by providing them with a diverse collection of recipes rooted in African culinary traditions, while also incorporating global influences. Whether you're an experienced cook or just starting, Tasty Dishes offers a wide variety of recipes that empower users to create delicious, flavorful meals from the comfort of their homes.


## Business Goal 
### Objective
The main objective of this project is to develop an item-based recipe recommendation system that suggests recipes to users based on the ingredients they have available. By analyzing the ingredients present in various recipes, the system aims to provide relevant and appealing recommendations that encourage users to explore and cook diverse dishes rooted in African culinary traditions, while also incorporating global flavors.

### Scope

1. Ingredient-Based Recommendations: Develop an algorithm that analyzes user-provided ingredients to recommend recipes based on ingredient similarity, leveraging a diverse dataset that includes recipe_Title, Ingredients, and Instructions for authentic African and global dishes.

2. User-Friendly Interface: Design an intuitive web interface that enables users to input their available ingredients and view tailored recipe recommendations, along with detailed cooking instructions and a feedback mechanism to enhance recommendation accuracy.


### Success Criteria
1. Accuracy:
Achieve at least 80% accuracy in recommending relevant recipes based on user-provided ingredients.

2. Precision:
Ensure that at least 75% of recommended recipes correspond to the userâ€™s input ingredients.

3. Recall:
Aim for a recall rate of at least 70%, indicating the system identifies a significant portion of relevant recipes.

4. F1 Score:
Target an F1 score of 0.75 or higher, balancing precision and recall for comprehensive recommendations.
